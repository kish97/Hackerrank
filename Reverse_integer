/*
Algorithm:
1. n%10 will give remainder
2. To reverse a number, we should add this at highest place
    how to add this at highest place?...
    one clever way to do this is, 
    reverse = reverse * 10 + rem;
    what this will do ?
    It will add remainder to last position at first but later on as we multiply it by 10,
    it keeps on moving towards left making it highest place.
    while(n!=0){
        rem = n %10;
        reverse = reverse * 10 +rem;;
        n = n/10;
    }

    rem=reverse = 0;
    
    while(n!=0){
        rem = n %10;
        reverse = reverse * 10 +rem;;
        n = n/10;
